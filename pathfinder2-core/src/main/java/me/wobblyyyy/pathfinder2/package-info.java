/**
 * Pathfinder's main package - welcome!
 *
 * <p>
 * As you can (probably) see, the Pathfinder project is split up into many
 * different packages for organizational purposes. The main
 * {@link me.wobblyyyy.pathfinder2.Pathfinder} class is the only class that's
 * in the package {@code me.wobblyyyy.pathfinder2} - all other classes are
 * in subpackages, such as {@code robot} or {@code geometry}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The name of each of the subpackages should describe it's purpose fairly
 * well. If you're browsing Pathfinder's source code, you might want to take
 * note of the module structure there is - there's {@code pathfinder2-geometry},
 * as well as {@code pathfinder2-core} et al.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There's a lot of content in this library, so I can't exactly list everything
 * in one convenient document, but if you'd like to get started learning the
 * library, you should check out the {@link me.wobblyyyy.pathfinder2.Pathfinder}
 * class and anything associated with it. Another solid idea is to check out
 * tutorials linked on the project's GitHub page - those might help.
 * </p>
